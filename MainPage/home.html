    <h1>GIS Assignments from GEOG 370: Introduction to GIS</h1>
    <h2>Emma Holmes</h2>
    <h3>These GIS Assignments were all completed using QGIS.</h3>
    
    <h3>Homework 1: Create a Map</h3>
    <img src="./maps/homework1.png" alt="Homework 1" width="500px">
    <p>I created a map of Mecklenburg County to practice using vector data. </p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG370/Homework2/index.html"><h3>Homework 2: My Life in Chapel Hill</h3></a>
    <img src="./maps/MyLifeInChapelHill.png" alt="Homework 2" width="500px">
    <p>I created a map showing locations and routes on UNC's campus that I frequent. </p>
    
    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG370/homework3/worldprojections.html"><h3>Homework 3: World Projections</h3></a>
    <p>I mapped different projections on a global scale to see what aspects of the map were distorted and which were kept. </p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG370/homework4/tile1.html"><h3>Homework 4: Georeferencing Chapel Hill</h3></a>
    <img src="./maps/HolmesHomework4.png" alt="Homework 4" width="500px">
    <p>I practiced georeferencing an image of Chapel Hill using control points, I then uploaded it to GitHub as a tiled web map. </p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG370/homework5/seattletile.html"><h3>Homework 5: Georeferencing Seattle</h3></a>
    <img src="./maps/homework5.png" alt="Homework 5" width="500px">
    <p>I practiced georeferencing using control points but this time with an old satellite image of Seattle. I also uploaded it as a tiled web map. </p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG370/homework6/homework6.html"><h3>Homework 6: Census Data</h3></a>
    <img src="./maps/homework6.png" alt="Homework 6" width="500px">
    <p>I created a choropleth map showing childbirth in North Carolina. </p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG370/homework6.2/homework6.2.html"><h3>Homework 6.2: Ratios and Classifications</h3></a>
    <p>I fixed my previous choropleth map by creating a ratio to better look at fertility in North Carolina. I 
        then used this map to list pros and cons for three different classification methods: Equal Intervals, 
        Natural Intervals, and Quantile. 
    </p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG370/homework7/index.html"><h3>Homework 7: Choropleth Map</h3></a>
    <img src="./maps/homework7.png" alt="Homework 7" width="500px">
    <p>I created a choropleth map showing the percentage of binge drinking per county in Utah. If I redid this map 
        I would change the color scheme so black was the highest percentage rather than the lowest. I would also make 
        the lines between counties a grey or white color to make it easier to distinguish different counties.
    </p>

    <a href="https://emkaholmes.github.io/GEOG370/homework8/index.html"><h3>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h3></a>
    <img src="./maps/updated_homework8.png" alt="Homework 8" width="500px">
    <p>I created a map that answered the question "How many health sites are in each city with a population over 
        100,000 in Bosnia and Herzegovina?"</p>

    <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/3283bd6c4532cf79329566edab4da29b"><h3>Homework 9: Google Earth Engine</h3></a>
    <img src="./maps/homework9.PNG" alt="Homework 9" width="500px">
    <p> This is the only assignment that was not completed on QGIS and was instead completed on Google Earth Engine. 
        I looked at health sites in the Sarajevo canton of Bosnia and Herzegovina and used a buffer to see if there 
        were any areas of the canton that lacked easy access to health sites.
