    <h3>I chose this data because I saw it on the Utah's state government's data website and was curious about what 
        the data would show in terms of each county. I was primarily curious about this because Utah is a primarily 
        Mormon state and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the primary Mormon church) does not allow 
        drinking.
