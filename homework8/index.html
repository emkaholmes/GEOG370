    <h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>

    <h2>My Map</h2>

    <h3>
        I created this map to answer the question "How many health sites are in each city with a population over 
        100,000 in Bosnia and Herzegovina?"
        <br> To answer this, I created a 15 kilometer buffer around each of the city points then used intersection 
        to get the healthsites that were only inside these buffers. I used intersection instead of clip so that the 
        data of which city the health site is in would not be lost. I then used queries to select and export the 
        health sites within each city to their own data.
